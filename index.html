          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Motivation and Learning Objective<span class="text-muted">&nbsp; Our goal and why we sought to accomplish it</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">
            The Mystic Massacre VR project seeks to recreate the namesake event that occured in Connecticut during the Pequot War (1636-1638). Our goal in designing this project was to allow users to learn about some of the brutal atrocities that the colonists carried out in their retaliatory attacks against the Pequot Indians. This specific instance was selected for our project because we have adequate resources to historically support our representations both of the appearance of the camp before the attack was executed and of the events of the attack itself. We aimed to display how violent the era of American settlement and colonization was, especially between the native peoples and the English colonists.</br></br>As a group, we believe that our rendition of the Mystic massacre in a virtual experience is a viable and valuable method of giving users insight to the brutal nature of the colonial era. More so than a reading on the event, users will be able to experience the attack as if they were part of it themselves. This provides an additional layer to learning about the attack and is conducive to users being able to put themselves more completely into the shoes of those who were attacked.

          <h2 class="featurette-heading">Design Concepts<span class="text-muted">&nbsp; An analysis of our aim to increase presence through world design</span></h2>
          <p class="lead">
            Proper world design is of vital importance to constructing a believable virtual environment that users will be able to find presence in. Through an appropriate dusk-time skybox, contexual geometry in the form of a densely forested area surrounding the camp, fundamental geometry in the number of housing units each individually populated with interactive objects, we believe that our Pequot settlement truly evokes a strong sense of presence. Having our experience set in the late evening allows us to create a more interesting environment through night-time lighting. We use a combination of fire pits and torches to provide soft illumination throughout the camp. The night-time setting also allows us to make use of audio clues such as the chirping of forest wildlife and the crackle of fires that would otherwise be absent, or at least realistically muted, in a day-time environment. This should lead many users to becoming more personally involved with the virtual environment. </br></br>To expand on our use of fundamental geometry in the world, we have a large number of huts to evoke a sense of being in a real community or camp. Each hut is furnished with a source of lighting, usually a bedmat, and other small props which change between each unit for the sake of individualization. Each hut also has a cloth-door that can be moved out of the way (by walking up to, and through, the door) to enter each unit. We rotated the props in each home to make the world a bit more believable - it would be hard to believe that everyone had the same layout to their living space. We believe that the sum of our audiovisual clues comes together to accurately and successfully represent the experience of being in a Pequot camp, setting the stage very well for the user to be a part of the attack in the camp.
